## Introduction

Our goal is to leverage Next.js's static site generation (SSG) capabilities to build a high-performance waiting list page, and use Google Forms as the backend to receive user-submitted email information. With this approach, we can quickly and cost-effectively create a waiting list page without having to write any backend code for data collection.

Demo URL: https://waitlist.saasfly.io

## ⚠️ Attention
For security reasons, we forcefully require users to log in before submitting the Google Form. You can turn off this requirement in the test environment or if your use case doesn't need this level of security.
